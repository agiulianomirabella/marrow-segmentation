                This video illustrates the performance of the first approach I adopted to segment the bone marrow in a chest CT for a project called: "Oncology Radiotherapy Results Prediction in Lung Cancer Patients". 
                The highlighted pixels represent the region positively identified as bone marrow, while the rest of anatomical structures are shown in background in lighter gray scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                The code is available <a href="https://github.com/agiulianomirabella/marrow-segmentation">here</a>. However, the project was unfortunately interrupted, because of COVID-19 pandemic, before further improvements could be done.
